# SARC-Code
Data Structures and Algorithms in C

Throughout my journey as a SARC Tutor, I've written a lot more code on the whiteboard than I thought I would, and in order to preserve the code for future use, I decided to use an online compiler in my tutoring sessions. Now, I save my code here in this repo for anyone to use.

Disclaimer: I had Professor Szumlanski as my teacher for Computer Science 1, and often refer back to his notes. Some of the code may be unintentionally used from his notes.
